# How to send a D-Mail

The instructions are very simple.

First, you turn on the 42" CRT TV sitting in Braun's shop in the first floor.

And only then you can send a D-Mail using the specially crafted `dmail!` command.

```rust
use future_gadget_laboratory::{dmail, turn_on_42inch_crt};

#[turn_on_42inch_crt]
fn main() {
    println!("I am mad scientist..");

    dmail!("Hououin Kyouma!");

    println!("El Psy Kongroo.");
}
```

You should notice the name of the famous mad scientist being printed even before he starts speaking. Truly amazing technology.

# Is there a risk of gelification?

More experiments are to come.

# Should you use it?

No.
